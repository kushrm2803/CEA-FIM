# CEA-FIM: Original Algorithm

This repository branch (`original`) contains the **baseline implementation** of the Community-based Evolutionary Algorithm for Fair Influence Maximization (CEA-FIM).

This code serves as the foundation upon which enhanced fairness-aware methods (found in other branches) are built and compared. It strictly follows the algorithm as described in the original paper.

## Reference

The algorithm in this branch is a direct implementation of the paper:
[Community-based Evolutionary Algorithm for Fair Influence Maximization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10542566)
